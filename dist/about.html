            <h3 class="text-secondary">BIO</h3>
            <p>I’m Kenyi James. I’m a designer who codes. I’ve work in-house and remotely on projects for
            leading brands, agencies, startups and charities. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful and beautiful
            products that help people and make a difference. I like to be involved at different stages of a digital project, from
            the seed of the idea, through to sketches, design and even the front-end and WordPress build. As a freelancer, this
            means I can jump in at any stage of a project, or take on the whole project, from design to build. 
            <h5>My Reputation</h5>
            <p> is character, and character is brand. As a result of my great repute my clients know that I am highly
            motivated by appreciation.
            <br>
            Beeing appreciated spurs me to continuously work tirelessly to give my clients worthwhile and unique services.</p>

            <h3>Understanding</h3>
            <h6>I design with understanding and affection of your brand</h6>
            <p>One of my top priorities is making sure I understand the needs of my clients and their web design. Always working within
            their budget, exceeding expectations, and keeping in mind the ultimate marketing goal, are just some of the attributes I
            apply to my client projects.
            
            By devising the best possible strategy for each client and their budget, I am able to guarantee success above and beyond
            other web designers. In addition, my clients become top competitors in their industry, ranking high in search engine
            optimization, once their new website goes live.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="job job-2">
            <h3>Personal Attention</h3>
            <h6>I know the difference of custom and customized</h6>
            <p>I understand that every company is different for different goals. Part of my role is to pay personal attention to each
            customer, taking in consideration the primary features needed to address the critical aspects of their marketing
            strategy. Each web design is custom-made, which expands upon my belief of providing personal attention.
            
            Below are the characteristics and considerations that go into every one of my freelance web design projects:
            
            <ol>
                <li>statically appealing</li>
                <li>integrated company message</li>
                <li>User-friendly</li>
                <li>Readily available information</li>
                <li>High performance</li>
                <li>Calls to action</li>
                <li>Search Engine Optimized</li>
            </ol></p>
        </div>

        <div class="job job-3">
            <h3>Half Cost</h3>
            <h6>My fees are about half of what other web designers with similar experience charge.</h6>
            <p>Because of my ability to work smart and effectively, I am able to provide clients with lower cost estimates than other
            freelance designers. After step one in the process, where we have an initial meeting, I am able to provide client with a
            cost. One thing my clients have discovered is that creativity and professionalism is not jeopardized by lower costs. In
            fact, they are always appreciative of the thought that goes into every website.</p>
