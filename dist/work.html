          <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
          <h6>For all browsers and devices</h6>
          <p>
            Because of the rapidly increasing use of mobile devices, my web
            designs are created as responsive website designs. Starting with
            design mockups, the code my team and I use translates across all
            mobile devices and browsers. The code we write is clean, and
            effective. The end result is a fast loading and visually appealing
            website. We know that there are many web browsers available, and
            therefore, we craft your websites to be compatible with each of
            them, such as: Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, iOS and the
            Android browser.

          <h3>Custom WordPress Design</h3>
          <h6>I know the difference of custom and customized</h6>
          <p>

            with the WordPress website. They want the simplicity of WordPress,
            with the customization ability to match their brand. With the tools
            available to me, I incorporate branding, web design, graphics,

          <h3>Website Speed Optimization</h3>
          <p>
            A slow website can make or break whether or not a visitor sticks around. In fact, they say that 57%
            of online shoppers
            will stick around for more than 3 seconds. Keeping this in mind, my team and I program websites to
            load faster than
            those 3 seconds, all while adhering to the integrity and quality of the graphics and user
            experience.
          
            Your web design will include these features:
          
            I will:

              <li>Optimize html code</li>
              <li>Removal of unnecessary code to include: CSS/JavaScript</li>
              <li>Merge multiple JavaScript files into one file, reducing http requests</li>
              <li>Merge background images into one image through CSS sprites.</li>
              <li>Minify the need for CSS and JavaScript.</li>

          <p>
            Naturally, many clients that come to me have products to sell. This
            means they want visitors to be able to online shop and go through
            customer checkouts on their site. My goal is to make it as easy and
            streamlined as possible for the client and their customers. In

            stores from scratch.

          <p>
            Every website I design contains built-in, flexible content
            management systems. This allows clients to receive a dynamic custom
            website design that allows them to add or edit content in a specific
            area without needing to understand programming. With nearly a decade
            experience of developing powerful web apps, my team and I have
            worked on many large projects to include social networking sites and
            e-commerce solutions. Our code is cleanly written and user-friendly
            for all of our client designed apps.

            that you want your
            customers to be able to identify your brand, and because of this we pay special attention to
